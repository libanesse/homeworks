## Description

When this website is loaded, the user is greeted with a random image from the Harvard Museum of Art.  
The user is then prompted to click a button, that will generate a random quote from the QuoteGarden API.  
If the user likes the quote, they are able to save it to a list.  
The user can then "tweet" any saved quotes on that list directly to their twitter feed using the Twitter API.
